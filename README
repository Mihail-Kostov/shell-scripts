My scriptlets
=============
These are scriptlets that I have found useful and worth reusing in little utility applications I seem to write over and over again. In the hopes that this might prove useful for other people out there, this repo is public. Let's just hope I do not hardcode my social security number or something... ;)

.sh files are scripts that can be run. These might depend on other library files.
.inc files are library functions that can be reused.

Other useful libraries might be used:
